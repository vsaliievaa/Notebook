# Notebook
This code is an example to explain how Python classes work and was taken from "Python 3 Object Oriented Programming" (second edition) by Dusty Phillips.

## Installation
To run the program on your computer, download all the code files or clone a repository from GitHub, and run a user_menu.py file.
## Running
The app suggests a very simple and intuitive interface. First of all, the user will see a menu and available oprtions. To add a new note, the user should enter "3" and then the memo they want to add. A message about successful creation of a note will appear immediately after that.

To modify the existing note, the user has to enter "4" and, again, follow the prompts that appear.
![Starting work](modify_note.png?raw="text")
To search for a specific letter combination or show all the notes, the user should enter "2" and "1" respectively.

Finally, to quit the notebook, the user has to press "5".
